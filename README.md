# Projectile Component
This is a Unity component that controls a projectile.

## Features
- The projectile will get the relative thickness of any object it hits and will only go through it if it's penetration value is greater then the thickness of the object.
- The projectile will reflect off of any object if the angle hit is equal to or smaller than the set ricochet angle. (In Development)
  
## Usage
- Download the Unity package and import it into your project
